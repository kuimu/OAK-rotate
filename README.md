# OAK-rotate
My goal is to rotate the camera clockwise by 90 degrees and install it to detect the position data (xyz) of the face and the posture angle data (RPY) of the head.
For RGB images and depth maps, I rotated them separately using ImageManip. However, after visualizing bbox, it was found that the ROI area was not on the face
